## Description

This is my venture into doing an entire web page from scratch.  This will end up being my portfolio that I will take with me on interviews.  With this portfolio I was able to add a visual of the first project we did, seo-refactor.  I also included a phote of myself, a small section that describes my work history, and a few links to where I can be found on social media
